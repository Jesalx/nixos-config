-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

return {
  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    "folke/which-key.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    opts = {
      -- delay between pressing a key and opening which-key (milliseconds)
      -- this setting is independent of vim.opt.timeoutlen
      delay = 0,
      preset = "helix",
      icons = {
        mappings = true,
        keys = {},
      },

      -- Document existing key chains
      spec = {
        { "<leader>s", group = "[S]earch" },
